# Test Orchestrator OS

This directory holds the NixOS config for the test orchestrator. Because of how many moving parts this project uses, for now I am assuming that the orchestrator is run on a dedicated piece of hardware however this may change going forward.

You must be on NixOS to build this ISO. I will be looking into distribiting the built-isos with releases in the future.
